# 🧠 Dopamind – Social Media Dopamine, Without Social Media

### Problem
Modern social media apps are engineered to hijack your attention through dopamine loops — endless scrolling, likes, notifications. You want the *dopamine boost* without the addiction and wasted time.

### Solution
**Dopamind** simulates the *reward experience* of social media without real feeds.  
It provides customizable dopamine feedback — colors, sounds, animations, “likes,” and micro-goals — helping you satisfy the brain’s craving loop while building mindful awareness of it.

You scroll, tap, react — but instead of falling into distraction, you train control.

### Features
- ⚡ *Simulated dopamine feed* — pseudo-notifications, likes, and comments.  
- 🎧 *Audio-visual rewards* with haptic feedback.  
- 🎯 *Focus modes* (Achievement / Connection / Discovery).  
- 🪞 *Mindful reflection* after each session.  
- 📊 *Mood tracking & dopamine map* over time.  
- 🧘 *Offline-first* — no login, no tracking.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter or React Native (for cross-platform tactile UI)  
- **Backend:** Local-only SQLite + optional sync via Supabase  
- **AI Engine:** Python (TensorFlow Lite) or ONNX for emotion simulation & dopamine scoring  
- **Design:** Minimal, dark theme with pulse-based feedback loops

### Architecture
```

User Input → Dopamine Engine → Reward Visualizer → Mood Tracker → Insight Dashboard

```

### Vision
Dopamind is a mirror for your mind.  
Instead of exploiting your attention, it helps you understand and train it.
